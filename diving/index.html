  <h2>Scuba Diving</h2>
    <p>I started diving in the early 1980s but then life, career, family and other more important things crowded it out. A few years ago I picked it up again, and I'm now making up for lost time. Being a geek I tend to over-analyze everything, and certain aspects of diving have been no exception. Most of the short papers I will post here began as email discussions with more experienced diving buddies about specific topics or gear that turned into lengthy discussions. I've organized and condensed them into the pages you'll find here, mostly just to wrap my own mind around the topics and tie up the loose ends. In almost all cases I will update each of these pages regularly.</p>

    <p>I only write about gear that I've bought, used, and abused myself. I've never received free gear, swag, or compensation of any kind from vendors.</p>

  <h3>Briefly:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://thescubaco.com">The Scuba Company</a> is my home shop, the best in the American Southwest.</li>
      <li>Everyone dismissed Boyen Slat when he set out to <a href="https://clamorworld.com/the-20-year-old-who-plans-to-remove-all-plastic-from-the-ocean/">remove all plastic from the ocean</a>. While they just read it about it and moved on <a href="https://theoceancleanup.com/updates/first-100000-kg-removed-from-the-great-pacific-garbage-patch/">he has now succeeded beyond expectations</a>. There is still abundant reason for pessimism, but at least the Ocean Cleanup gang is leading by example.</li>
      <li>It's hard to overstate the stress on our oceans from climate change, pollution, and over-fishing. Especially when you see dying coral and man-made debris on almost every dive around the world. The magnitude of the damage is so overwhelming that it's tempting to think there is nothing individuals can do to help. But there is. <a href="https://ghostdiving.org">Ghost Diving</a> is an all-volunteer organization quietly removing a small mountain of fishing nets and debris from the ocean. There are scores of other great organizations that you can volunteer your time and help support. Choose one and go.</li>
