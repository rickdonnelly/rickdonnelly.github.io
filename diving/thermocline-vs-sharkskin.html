  <h2>Fourth Element Thermocline versus Sharkskin Titanium Chillproof</h2>
  <font size=small>By Rick Donnelly | Saturday, 28 January 2023</font>

  <br>
  <p>I’m a big fan of <a href="https://fourthelement.com/product-category/wetsuits/thermocline/">Fourth Element’s Thermocline</a>, a fleece-lined synthetic fabric alternative to neoprene wetsuits. It's neutrally buoyant, comfortable, odorless, machine washable, and decently windproof. Best of all, it comes in several styles, from a single-piece full suit to several tops and bottoms. Until <a href="">Sharkskin Titanium Chillproof</a> hit my radar two years ago Thermocline seemed singular in both concept and performance in the marketplace. I've since dived in both offerings enough to know I'm never going back to a wetsuit again in the tropics, although it remains an open question whether I can use them instead when a 5mm wetsuit would be required. I've learned a lot through using them that hopefully others will find helpful.</p>

  <p>Both Sharkskin and Thermocline use proprietary fleece fabrics on the inside and smooth woven fabric on the outside. Neither will share what they're made from or how. Both are comfortable against the skin and easier to don and doff than a 3mm wetsuit. The Sharkskin exterior is coarser than the smoother Thermocline but not enough to affect the ease of gliding through the water.</p>

  <h2>Thermal retention</h2>

  <p>Some friends report that the Thermocline products insulate them as well as 3mm neoprene wetsuit, a claim that my experience largely validates. I've read some claims that the Sharkskin is warmer, possibly a viable substitute for a 5mm wetsuit. The Sharkskin does seem warmer to me, but if I had to assign a number, it might be 4mm equivalence. However, several things work against either living up to their full potential. The first is that the collars are cut lower than a comparable wetsuit. The difference is slightly more pronounced in the Sharkskin, but neither prevents water from entering the suit, especially if you dive with hands clasped in front of you. This, coupled with the fabrics being less stretchy and form-fitting than neoprene, makes these suits function somewhat like a poor-fitting wetsuit.</p>

  <p>The other place water enters is through the wrist cuffs. This isn't an issue if you get a great seal because the suit fits your wrists exactly. The straps on my dive computer seal it well on my left side. While my suits fit snugly in most places, there is enough slack in the wrists for water to continually flow in without something on my wrist to prevent it.</p>

  <h2>Sizing</h2>

  <p>Both products only come in major sizes (e.g., medium, large), with no offerings for longer legs and (more limiting) no intermediate sizes. This is in contrast to 3mm wetsuits, for which there is an order of magnitude more choices. The Fourth Element <a href= "https://fourthelement.com/product-category/wetsuits/proteus-ii/">Proteus II wetsuits</a>, for example, are available in 16 different sizes.</p>

  <p>If you fit a major size you're in luck, but being a medium-large in most offerings has made using both brands an acceptable rather than great experience for me. They're really tight in medium, loose in some places in large, and stretch slightly when wet. You should strive for a snug fit in the store. Hold the same position you will dive in (prone, with knees bent at 90 degrees and arms out in front) when you try them on to ensure that "snug" isn't too tight.</p>

  <p>There is an essential trade-off in sizing: sizing down a size will help form better seals, reducing the water entering the suit. But it also compresses the fleece lining, which presumably was selected to loft somewhat to hold warmed water in place. Sizing up allows the fleece to do its thing but at the expense of seals. For someone between sizes like me, it means just accepting that the thermal efficiency of the suit is compromised by design and using it within those limitations. I've settled on larger rather than tighter, finding that more comfortable on longer dives. I don't like the bagginess that occurs in my thighs and arms when wet, but that beats being uncomfortable in a compression suit.</p>

  <p>The verdict is still out on whether either suit permanently stretches through repeated use. Both vendors insist they do not, but a trusted dive shop operator with experience with both think they do. After about 50 dives each, I have not seen any stretching. I will update this as I gain more experience with them.</p>

  <h2>Drying times</h2>

  <p>The ads for these suits claim that quick drying is one of their advantages. That is true only in the low humidity and perpetual sunshine of New Mexico. Both offerings are mostly dry within a few hours when hung outside there. The exceptions are the waistbands, which take longer to dry. But it's a different story in the tropics. Hanging them inside out helps both products dry quicker, but drying takes longer.</p>

  <p>In Cozumel and Roatán, the insides of the Sharkskin tops and bottoms dried overnight if left in the breeze after wringing them out thoroughly before hanging. The outer fabric, being on the inside while drying, was mildly damp. The waistband on the tops and bottoms were still wet when we put them back on. The Thermocline tops and bottoms took roughly 24 hours to dry as thoroughly as the Sharkskin did overnight. The waistbands were also still wet at that point.</p>

  <p>In all fairness, our 3mm wetsuits didn't completely dry overnight, either. When hung inside out, the insides were dry but the outer shell was still damp. It was a tie between them and the Sharkskin. All that said, getting back into damp suits in warm tropics is a whole lot less onerous than in cooler locales when thicker wetsuits are called for.</p>

  <h2>Durability</h2>

  <p>After about 50 dives in both products, the seams and fabric are holding up well. The Sharkskin shell has snagged in several places from contact with moving boat surfaces and harnesses. It has not done so enough to affect the performance or appearance of the suit so far. The smoother Thermocline has no snags despite being used in the same environments. I usually wear them on alternating days when diving for a week or longer, which exposes them to the same marine environment, boat, and types of diving.</p>

  <h2>One piece versus two</h2>

  <p>I prefer to dive in a full suit, as it keeps the sun off my forearms and calves and reduces jellyfish misery. I use a one-piece Thermocline suit, as the separate tops and bottoms don't overlap enough on me to prevent the former from riding up my lower torso when snorkeling and creating another path for water to enter and exit my suit.</p>

  <p>I was dismayed that a one-piece Sharkskin Titanium suit doesn't exist. But I was pleasantly surprised that there is enough overlap to create a good seal with separate tops and bottoms. The rougher exterior fabric resisted the interior fleece gliding across it like the Thermocline. I'd still like a one-piece Sharkskin suit, but a two-piece solution works better than expected and dries easier.</p>

  <p>Neither vendor makes a true shorty. Fourth Element came close with their spring suit, which no longer appears on their website. It was a shorty bottom with a long-sleeved top. It's comfortable, but jellyfish seem to spot my unprotected legs from further away than I can see them, so I don't use it often. I've often thought about cutting the sleeves off to make it into a true shorty, but I suspect it will be hard to separate the shell fabric from the fleece to make the arm cuffs work. Fourth Element declined to customize a spring suit for me that way.</p>

  <p>Both Fourth Element and Sharkskin have shorts and vests that work great in warm water if you eschew full suits. I often wear these beneath the full suit for additional warmth in chillier water, with longer hang times, or on windy, overcast days topside.</p>

  <h2>Bottom line</h2>

  <p>You cannot go wrong with either brand. Choose between them based on which fits better. They are supremely comfortable, and I really love their neutral buoyancy. As I gained experience with them, I reached for the Sharkskin more often than the Thermocline. It feels warmer, albeit not significantly so, and I like the stirrups better than the open ankles on the Thermocline suit. If one vendor starts offering a medium-large size that will completely change the calculus for me, but otherwise, I prefer either of them to 3mm wetsuit.</p>

  <p> I'm less bullish about using these suits when a 5mm wetsuit might be required. I've worn my Thermocline vest and shorts under both suits a few times, and they certainly extend the range of the suit -- assuming you've sized up when purchasing the outer suit as I did. But your legs and arms will definitely feel chilled on longer dives compared to being in a 5mm wetsuit. I don't wear a hood if I'm trying to gain 3mm equivalency, but I usually use the Sharkskin hood to push to 5mm equivalence. I cannot recommend both products highly enough.</p>
