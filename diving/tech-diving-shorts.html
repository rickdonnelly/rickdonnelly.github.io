  <p>The gist: Tech shorts are almost essential for carrying all the loose items I don’t dive without. This covers the gamut from flashlights and wetnotes to backup masks, bungees, and cutters. Unless you only carry a few things, the choice quickly narrows down to two excellent but pricey choices.</p></blockquote>

  <br>

  <p>It is rare that a piece of diving gear goes from irrelevant to essential overnight. For me, it has been technical diving shorts, especially after finding what a great combo they are with <a href= “https://waterproof.eu/products/wetsuits/w30-fullsuit/”>my shorty</a> or <a href=”https://fourthelement.com/product-category/wetsuits/thermocline/”>Fourth Element Thermocline</a> one-piece front-zip or spring suit. Carrying slate, finger reel, DSMB, flashlight, spare mask, and so on in the expandable pockets of the shorts is a <i>lot</i> more convenient and streamlined than hanging them off of my harness.</p>

  <p>Tech shorts are for backmount diving only. In sidemount, I cannot wear them, or suits with thigh pockets, because they push the base of the cylinders away from the body, creating an inefficient “A-frame” profile rather than the tucked-in and streamlined profile required. Sidemounters move all of their gear to a <a href="http://www.xdeep.eu/stealth-sidemount-pouch-cargo-pocket-pr-110.html">single pouch</a> that clips to the back of their harness below the wing, giving new meaning to the term fanny pack. I had noodled the idea of clipping such a pouch to the front of my harness when diving backmounts, but in the end, I decided on shorts. Plus, having two pockets instead of one gave me the ability to separate reel and DSMB, which I use more often, from an extra mask, backup light, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Emergency-Underwater-Survival-Koala-Lanyards/dp/B071WX5D6S/">super-loud whistle</a>, which I don’t.</p>

  <p>I didn’t try on every pair of tech shorts out there, but my obsession with finding the best did entail trying several brands. I started by trying <a href= “https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072C8RWNZ/”>regular cargo shorts</a> over a shorty, thinking that I didn’t want the additional buoyancy from neoprene diving shorts. Everything fit in the pockets, albeit tightly, except for the DSMB,  which had to stay clipped to my harness. This seemed to work until needing to take something out at depth, in which case <i>everything</i> came out. There are no loops to secure gear unless you sew them in yourself. It became readily apparent on the first dive why neoprene was the fabric of choice in tech diving shorts. I hadn’t thought about how nice it was to have the neoprene offsetting the additional weight of the gear within them.</p>

  <p>The first pair to hit my radar was the <a href="https://www.divegearexpress.com/highland-neoprene-pocket-shorts">DGX neoprene shorts</a>, which I had seen recommended on several dive forums online. They are made with 2mm neoprene and fit fine. My fatal flaw was that my rolled-up <a href="https://www.halcyon.net/super-big-closed-circuit-dam-18-m-6ft-tall-and-236-kg-52-lb-lift,391,en">DSMB</a> was larger than the pocket.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.mares.com/shop/us-US/tek-shorts-7.html">Mares Tek Shorts</a> impressed me. Their waist adjustment is <b>so</b> much more comfortable than the pricier tech shorts considered below, for it doesn’t involve the heavy-duty plastic buckle. Unlike everyone else, the fabric is some Kevlar blend rather than neoprene. They have two large pockets with D-rings on straps. They are almost perfect, although I prefer the stretchy neoprene fabric more after using both. Sadly for me, they fit perfectly in the butt or in the waist, but not both.</p>

  <p>I next tried a friend’s pair of <a href="https://fourthelement.com/technical-shorts/">Fourth Element tech shorts</a>. All of my loose gear fit in a lot easier, as the Fourth Element pockets are deeper than most others. The fit and comfort of these shorts are simply unbelievable. They fit me almost like they were custom-made and didn’t move at all during my dives or walking around topside. The fabric is also 2mm thick, and the buckle is offset from the center. I would love to replace the buckle with a simple velcro belt like the Mares shorts. Alas, the belt isn’t removable. These shorts run $260, which seems steep compared to the others -- until you try them on.</p>

  <p>One thing my buddies and I don’t like about the Fourth Element shorts is that bungee loops are used for anchoring the gear inside. They’re okay, but I prefer metal D-rings to which I can easily clip bolt snaps, and I worry about their longevity. The differences between D-rings and bungees are admittedly small when pulling stuff out. It’s clipping things back in that’s onerous. Sometimes I’ve had to go fishing for the bungee, especially when many things are clipped to it. You have to look at the pockets when clipping stuff onto the bungee, whereas I can find it by feeling with D-rings that are always in the same place.</p>

  <p>Also at the high end is the <a href="https://us.apeksdiving.com/en/divewear/shorts/tech-shorts-SU817.html">Apeks tech shorts</a>, recently updated in 2021. They’re only 1.5 mm thick, which I thought would be significant, but they weren’t noticeably different than 2 mm shorts. The pockets are huge when expanded, although they don’t drain instantly as the Fourth Element shorts do. They’re equally comfortable, but for me, they didn’t fit as perfectly as the Fourth Elements. And they slowly slide down my waist when walking around during surface intervals.</p>

  <p>On the plus side I like the grip that the rubberized butt provides, especially on Zodiac boats. The pockets have D-rings and, like the Fourth Elements, have a thinner inner pocket for wetnotes or dive slates on each side. They cost $210, so slightly more economical than the high-end Fourth Element shorts.</p>

  <p>The Apeks shorts are almost perfect. I don’t like the highly prominent branding on both pockets <i>and</i> across the back. I didn’t go to the trouble of measuring how far away they were visible, but my dive buddies told me that the Apeks advertisements were visible from much further away than anything else on me.</p>

  <p>Bottom line: I’ve kept both the Apeks and Fourth Element shorts. I tend to use the former more on tech dives but the latter on recreational dives, when I pull out and put back gear a lot less. Regardless of the use case, you cannot go wrong with either pair of shorts, allowing you to choose based on how well they fit. But if neither existed, the Mares shorts would still be an awesome pick.</p>
