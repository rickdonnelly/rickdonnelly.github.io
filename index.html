	<h2>Enjoying the digital road far less traveled...</h2>
	<p>An informal collection of musings about work, diving, and amateur radio. I created this thinking that once working I'd move it all into WordPress and make it pretty. But I like clean, minimal, and simple, and this checks all those boxes for me. If you need to contact me you can find details for that in the <a href="/about">About</a> page.</p>
