  <h2 style="padding:0px; margin:0px;">Preparing for a career in computational psychiatry</h2>
  <byline>By Rick Donnelly | Updated Friday, 27 January 2023</byline>

  <br>

  <p>Computational psychiatry (CP) is a mash-up of psychiatry, engineering, and artificial intelligence. No one is going to be an expert in all of those fields. Indeed, CP is a team effort rather than a solo endeavor. However, having a solid background in those areas is a necessary foundation. ETH Zurich will hopefully soon offer a graduate diploma that expands upon its phenomenal <a href="https://www.translationalneuromodeling.org/cpcourse/">Computational Psychiatry Course</a> (CPC). Until then, you pretty much have to build your own program.</p>

  <h3>But wait...</h3>
  <p>Most of your work will be on the front end before you take the CPC in Zurich or elsewhere. The CPC will nicely tie everything together for you and provide an excellent overview of where the field is headed. Unless your undergraduate degree was in math, statistics, engineering, or computer science with an emphasis on machine learning and AI, you'd need to fill some gaps, as needed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I'm told that the online <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/essential-linear-algebra-for-data-science">Essential Linear Algebra for Data Science</a> course is excellent and concise, but I still need to look into it myself.</li>
    <li>If you lack a solid grasp of basic statistics, there is no better intro than Andy Field's entertaining <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adventure-Statistics-Reality-Enigma/dp/1529797136/">An Adventure in Statistics</a>. Get the newer second edition. </li>
    <li>Spend a rainy afternoon going through Peter Attia's five-part series on "Studying Studies" (<a href="https://peterattiamd.com/ns001/">start here</a>). They pair nicely with Merlot.</li>
    <li>Finally, take Andrew Ng's highly-acclaimed three-course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction">Machine Learning Specialization</a> through Coursera. At some point, you might also want to pursue the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning">Deep Learning Specialization</a>, but it can wait until you're doing work in that direction.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Do you need all this background just to understand the CPC lectures? Probably not, although some of it will go over your head without it. Perhaps the best way to do it is (a) to take the course in person, (b) fill in the gaps above, and then (c) to retake the course or watch the videos online.</p>
