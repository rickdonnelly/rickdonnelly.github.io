  <h1>Amateur Radio</h1>
  <p>This has been a hobby for mine for several years. I am mostly into low power (<5 watts) digital communications on higher bands. My favorite targets for contacts are islands in the Indian Ocean. I keep my skills sharp by volunteering on a communications team with <a href="https://www.bcnm.com/disaster-relief/">Southern Baptist Disaster Relief</a>. Most of the musing I post here will be inspired by work in that realm.</p>
