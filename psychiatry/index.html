    <h2>Psychiatry</h2>
      <p>My interest in computational psychiatry (CP) started late but I'm making up for lost time. I'll post some general stuff here that doesn't directly relate to projects I'm working on. As with everything else on my webpage, all of these writings reflect my own views only, some of which might depart from what friends and colleagues follow.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="learning-cp.html">Preparing for career in in computational psychiatry</a></li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Briefly:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>It's impossible to overstate how important the <a href="https://www.translationalneuromodeling.org/cpcourse/">Computational Psychiatry Course</a> at ETH Zurich has been in the development of this nascent field. There are other crash courses but nothing like this.</li>
      <li>A lot people ask how CP will change the practice of psychiatry. I'm the wrong person to answer that, but I like some of the ideas advanced in "Integrating evolutionary, cultural, and computational psychiatry: A multilevel systemic approach" <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.763380/full">(Constant et al. 2022)</a>.</li>
      <li>Some of the leading conferences have sessions devoted to CP topics but there is no CP conference. We need to change that.</li>
