  <h2 style="padding:0px;">Preparing for a career in computational psychiatry</h2>
  <font size=small style="color:SlateGray">By Rick Donnelly | Updated Friday, 26 January 2023</font>

  <p>Computational psychiatry (CP) is a mash-up of psychiatry, engineering, and artificial intelligence. No one is going to be an expert in all of those fields. Indeed, CP is a team effort rather than a solo endeavor. However, having a solid background in those areas is a necessary foundation. ETH Zurich will hopefully soon offer a graduate diploma that expands upon its phenomenal <a href="https://www.translationalneuromodeling.org/cpcourse/">Computational Psychiatry Course</a> (CPC). Until then, you pretty much have to build your own program.</p>

  <p>The ETH Zurich CPC is the essential cornerstone for building your CP portfolio. It's offered both online and in person. The consensus among several alums, myself included, is that attending in person is essential to get the most from it. If you're online, you miss the ability to ask questions between lectures, feed on the enthusiasm in the room, meet the titans in the field in person, and the great discussions and socialization outside the lectures. I've heard about similar offerings starting to be offered elsewhere, but none sound close to the magic, breadth, and quality that the ETH team has put together. And it gets better every year.</p>

  <p>If a broad overview is all you're after, you can take the course and be done. Building a portfolio is not a bad analogy if aspiring to work in CP. How you do so depends upon which pillars you come into CP already strong in. I've combined my experiences with advice from colleagues below.</p>

  <p>There is a CPC <a href="https://github.com/computational-psychiatry-course/precourse-preparation">recommended reading</a> list. Definitely pay attention to that. But at least for me, it is only the tip of the iceberg. The recommendations below seem overwhelming, especially if you're moving into CP from clinical practice or a different field. Many people I've met complain that they don't need to know most of this stuff for the particular project or program they are working on. Fair enough, but you can't wing it if you want to see the big picture, dream big, grasp the leading research, connect all the dots, and make breakthroughs.</p>

  <h3>Entering from psychiatry</h3>

  <p>Most of your work will be on the front end before you take the CPC in Zurich or elsewhere. The CPC will nicely tie everything together for you and provide an excellent overview of where the field is headed. Unless your undergraduate degree was in math, statistics, engineering, or computer science with an emphasis on machine learning and AI, you'd need to fill some gaps, as needed:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Knowing the fundamentals of calculus and linear algebra seems essential. I haven't followed the best online courses in calculus so assume that those listed in the <a href="https://github.com/computational-psychiatry-course/precourse-preparation">CPC reading list</a> are great. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/No-bullshit-guide-linear-algebra/dp/0992001021">No Bullshit Guide to Linear Algebra</a> is excellent for learning and reviewing those concepts. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Linear-Algebra-Data-Science/dp/1098120612/">Practical Linear Algebra for Data Science</a> is also a good starting point for book-based study. I'm told that the online <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/essential-linear-algebra-for-data-science">Essential Linear Algebra for Data Science</a> course is excellent and concise, but I still need to look into it myself.</li>
    <li>If you lack a solid grasp of basic statistics, there is no better intro than Andy Field's entertaining <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adventure-Statistics-Reality-Enigma/dp/1529797136/">An Adventure in Statistics</a>. Get the newer second edition. If you have a strong STEM background, you might get bored with it, but then again, you almost certainly already have that background.</li>
    <li>You can skip <a href="https://www.statlearning.com">Introduction to Statistical Learning</a> (ISL) and still pick up ML basics later, but you shouldn't. The book is excellent, but their <a href="https://www.statlearning.com/online-course">online course</a> is even better. Someone will eventually offer a comparable course slanted towards CP or <a href="https://zdoggmd.com/health-3-point-0/">Medicine 3.0</a>. Until then, this or a similar course will provide a great foundation and the ramp-up to machine learning.</li>
    <li>Read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/052170958X/">A Clinician's Guide to Statistics and Epidemiology in Mental Health</a>. It's not a primer on statistical methods. Instead, it focuses on how statistics are used and abused in psychiatry. It's a thin book that won't take long to get through. The wisdom to page count ratio on this book is off the charts.</li>
    <li>Spend a rainy afternoon going through Peter Attia's five-part series on "Studying Studies" (<a href="https://peterattiamd.com/ns001/">start here</a>). They pair nicely with Merlot.</li>
    <li>Finally, take Andrew Ng's highly-acclaimed three-course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction">Machine Learning Specialization</a> through Coursera. At some point, you might also want to pursue the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning">Deep Learning Specialization</a>, but it can wait until you're doing work in that direction.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Do you need all this background just to understand the CPC lectures? Probably not, although some of it will go over your head without it. Perhaps the best way to do it is (a) to take the course in person, (b) fill in the gaps above, and then (c) to retake the course or watch the videos online.</p>

  <h3>Entering from engineering</h3>

  <p>Most of your learning will be on the back end after the CPC. If you still need to take a good course in statistics, as too many engineers do, consider taking the <a href="https://www.statlearning.com/online-course">Introduction to Statistical Learning online course</a>. If you have yet to explore machine learning, watching something like the <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NOJOYcmyDhM">Machine Learning Crash Course</a> beforehand will get you through the course.</p>

  <p>Although not necessary to get through the course the Coursera <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computational-neuroscience">Neuroscience and Neuroimaging Specialization</a> is the best way to learn about functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I didn't think I'd need to know much about fMRI, but it seems so widely used that it's hard to keep up with the literature without understanding it. You may want to take the course at some point, but not before attending the CPC. The book I learned from, which goes satisfyingly deep on details but still covers all the bases, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging-Huettel/dp/0878936270/">Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging 3rd Edition</a>. There might be better and more recent textbooks out there, but no one in my orbit seems to know of any.</p>

  <p>The real work comes after the course. There is no online cram course on psychiatry that I'm aware of. The best way to cram an overview is to take off three weeks, rent a house on the Big Island in Hawaii, and read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0198754000/">Psychiatry 5th edition</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sadocks-Concise-Textbook-Clinical-Psychiatry/dp/1975167481/">Kaplan &amp; Sadock&#8217;s Concise Textbook of Clinical Psychiatry, 5th edition</a> cover to cover. They are textbooks that you can actually read/skim in their entirety; the authoritative works are much denser. Don't take notes or focus on details, and definitely don't memorize stuff. Just take it all in. Take frequent breaks, go for walks, and spend time in the ocean to break it all up.</p>

  <p>A close colleague suggests a variant on the cram course. She is all for blocking out a few weeks to do it, although there are certainly <a href="https://electricliterature.com/the-8-best-writing-retreats-that-wont-break-the-bank/">other great options</a> if you're not into islands. But she worries that current textbooks reinforce how we've thought about classifying mental illnesses for the past century. That's unhelpful, for machine learning will help us think about and classify mental illnesses in new ways. So, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sims-Symptoms-Mind-Descriptive-Psychopathology-dp-0702085251/dp/0702085251/">Sim's Symptoms in the Mind</a> instead. The 7th edition was released in the fall of 2022. I like how this book is laid out, and it reads well. Plus, you can probably get through it in a shorter time.</p>

  <p>While you're in Hawaii, zoom through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/052170958X/">A Clinician's Guide to Statistics and Epidemiology in Mental Health</a> and Peter Attia's <a href="https://peterattiamd.com/ns001/">Studying Studies</a>. Both focus on interpretation, not methods, and are full of wisdom and traps to avoid. You'll never look at studies reported in the literature the same way again.</p>

  <p>Machine learning is the final gap for most engineers. How much you need to learn can be gauged by reading <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-020-0767-z">Deep learning for small and big data in psychiatry</a>, an excellent paper by Koppe et al (2020). You can stop when you fully understand everything they write about and know how to implement it. Until then, start with Andrew Ng's <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction">Machine Learning Specialization</a> and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning">Deep Learning Specialization</a>. ML is moving forward at least as fast as CP, and there is a cross-over point where you start seeing possibilities that enable breakthroughs. I hope to close in on that point soon.</p>

  <h3>Entering from machine learning</h3>

  <p>Everyone I've met coming from a background in AI, or its machine learning subset, has an equally deep background in math and statistics as even PhD engineers do. They obviously have a superior grasp of AI and ML methods as well. Thus, the same recommendations from <a name= "head2">Entering from engineering</a> above apply. The difference is that all my ML friends have little interest in learning more about the psychiatry side of CP, whereas the engineers are frustrated with not seeing the bigger picture. This leads me back to the imperative for collaboration in CP. You can be a team player without knowing all of this stuff. However, if you aspire to lead teams, break new ground, and creatively integrate the work others are doing (especially outside of the field), you'll need a strong foundation in all three pillars.</p>
