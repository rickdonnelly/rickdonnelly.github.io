I will eventually throw up several articles on this site that started out as email exchanges with friends, got into more detail than really needed, and sort of developed a life of their own. Then someone wrote to complain that my observations were out of date, because someone sent them the last thing they found in their email, which was a year earlier than the most recent iteration. So, I'm putting it into a perpetual place that with any luck won't immediately get hijacked or locked down with randomware.
